                                <p className="text-white py-4" >Pre-production includes the planning and scheduling of a movie. The budget must be determined before filming can take place in order to determine what is needed for shooting locations, cast members, props, costumes, etc.</p>
                                <p className="text-white py-4" >The budget determines how much money will have to be spent on things like hiring actors or renting spaces that are required for filming.</p>
                                <p className="text-white py-4" >Pre-production also requires research into the script so that writers may find out if there are any issues with copyright protections or other legal concerns which might cause trouble during production.</p>
                                <p className="text-white py-4" >Researching a film takes time because it involves reading scripts and books as well as watching movies and television shows related to them.</p>
                                <p className="text-white py-4" >This information helps the filmmakers understand what they should keep when telling their story from personal experience.</p>
                                <p className="text-white py-4" >Apart from all that, booking locations, figuring out dates for all crew members, and coming up with a shooting schedule is crucial to the film.</p>

                                <p className="text-white py-4 text-5xl flex justify-center" >Production:</p>
                                <p className="text-white py-4" >In the production stage, all aspects are brought together for the creation of finished product. This includes actors, costumes, sets and locations as well as crew members like directors, producers and cinematographers.</p>
                                <p className="text-white py-4" >Making a film set: The place where crew shoots scenes, is the film set. It can be anything from an abandoned warehouse to someone’s backyard. But most often it will resemble some sort of public space.</p>
                                <p className="text-white py-4" >To ensure that movie sets look realistic, a lot of detailing is done in their creation. They use props and scenery that match with what might actually exist in the world we live in. If there isn’t enough time or money then they make smaller versions of space.</p>
                                <p className="text-white py-4" >These sets are called ‘insert shots’ because they’re only included during certain moments when needed for continuity purposes.</p>
                                <p className="text-white py-4" >Lighting is also crucial for a film set. It creates the mood and tone in scenes. And also highlights areas of importance that need to be seen by viewers. Good lighting for a film set is achieved by using various types of fixtures, such as floodlights and spotlights. These can be lamps on the floor or ceiling that are controlled from a central location with cords.</p>
                                <p className="text-white py-4" >Lighting challenges might include having to work in an unventilated space where there’s not enough room for lights and stands; but sometimes you’ll have the exact opposite problem – too much light coming through windows creating harsh shadows</p>
                                <p className="text-white py-4" >Coordination on the film set is really important to make sure that the crew members have everything they need and are aware of what’s going on.</p>
                                <p className="text-white py-4 text-5xl flex justify-center" >Post Production</p>
                                <p className="text-white py-4" >What is post production is an important part of the filmmaking process. Post-production includes editing, sound design, and color correction to produce a quality film. It’s important because it can be what makes or breaks your movie.</p>
                                <p className="text-white py-4" >For example, if you have some really beautiful shots but they’re not put together in an interesting way then people might get bored watching them which isn’t good for anyone.</p>
                                <p className="text-white py-4" >The final product has many components that determine whether or not it will turn out well – camera work, lighting, scenery, etc.</p>
                                <p className="text-white py-4" >If any one of these just doesn’t seem right then the whole project could go downhill. That’s why post-production is so important because editors are able to fix those problems while also making everything look nice</p>
                                <p className="text-white py-4" >One of the most important post-production jobs is sound editing. On set, the actors are constantly making noise and it’s a huge challenge to make sure that the dialog in the movie is clear without having all those background noises getting in the way too much</p>
                                <p className="text-white py-4" >It can also be difficult trying to match up different takes with what they’re saying because sometimes people say things differently or have trouble pronouncing certain words. Sound editors will go through each scene one by one painstakingly listening for every word said. And then cutting out any tiny unwanted sounds like breathing, sighs, sneezes, etc so all you hear is just what needs to be heard. You’ll also need an editor who does picture cuts which means they essentially put together pieces of footage.</p>
